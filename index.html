        <h1>Pie-Raydle</h1>
        <p>This game is a simplified version of pie-raying techniques from Minecraft speedrunning.</p>
        <p>Use on-screen buttons to increase or decrease detection radius and move.</p>
        <p>Or use WASD/arrow keys to move, F to increase radius and Shift+F to decrease radius.</p>
        <p>You can also press 3 or Shift+3 to toggle the F3 menu open and closed.</p>
    
        <column id="game-menu" class="left">
            <div>
                <p>The aim of the game is to get as low a time as possible, and get a low score.</p>
                <p>
                    Score increases by 1 point for each radius increase/decrease, and 10 points for each square travelled.

                    Be shown where the red target is immediately to help you wrap your head around the system/training
                    tool.

                    Have your radius visualised, and see which squares are candidates (in orange) or definitely empty
                    (in grey).

                <column class="game-mode">
                    <button id="start-hard">Start standard</button>
                    See nothing but the grid, and still try to find that target square.

                    <button id="start-chart-only">Start chart only</button>
                    Like in Minecraft, you only have the pie chart to work with. The pie chart indicates when a mob
                    spawner is loaded, but has a 4 chunk buffer in which it will stay loaded. So you need to decrease
                    your radius by 4 and then close and re-open the chart menu to successfully unload the spawner.
